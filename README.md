This project is a machine learningâ€“based flight delay prediction system.
It uses real flight datasets (airlines, airports, and flight schedules) to analyze delays and predict whether a flight will be on time or delayed. The workflow involves:

Data Collection & Cleaning

Raw datasets (airlines, airports, and flights) are cleaned and transformed.

Preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Statistical and visual analysis of flight patterns, delay causes, and relationships between features.

Model Training & Optimization

Machine learning models are trained on historical flight data.

Optimized models (saved as .pkl) are used to predict flight delays.

Evaluation

Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) are computed to assess model quality.

Prediction & Deployment

predict.py and routes.py suggest a prediction service or API is included.

Likely allows real-time or batch predictions on new flight data.
